These are just some of the common pages you may have in an e-commerce site. Depending on your project requirements, you can customize and add more pages as needed.

In addition to the pages, you'll also have a templates folder containing HTML templates for each page, and a static folder for CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets.

Make sure to structure your Flask application accordingly and organize your code in separate files for better maintainability and readability.
